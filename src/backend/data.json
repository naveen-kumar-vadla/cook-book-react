      "Return mixture to cleaned saucepan and place over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until custard thickens and thickly coats the back of a spoon.",

Layer three-quarters of the strawberries in the custard, pressing halves against the glass, and scatter with three-quarters of the blueberries. Repeat with another one-third of the custard and remaining jam rolls. Add remaining custard to top of jam rolls.",
